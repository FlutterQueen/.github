# Queen Project

# Problems

As a mobile developer most of the features you build in your apps is the same and almost identical, either you are rebuilding the same thing over and over or copying and pasting them in every single app

we believe this is bad , most likely

- there are no tests
- there is no standard files architecture to follow
- no one to maintain the code after you deliver
- unless you don't have a very strict process to review your code, it will easily become
  - unreadable
  - scattered between different files
  - slow
  - bugs üêõ

This project tries to solves these problems

## To The Moon üöÄ

at the end of day you will look for packages to use to skip inviting the wheel again

here we are
queen is not a framework, we are not that big , just a bunch of packages that plays well together , allowing you to build great apps without any effort
